## Install Dependencies

Project was developed with the usage of `Python 3.9.9`.

To install the required libraries use the following command:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Instructions for Executing Analysis Notebooks
* To execute the software the availability of an `NVIDIA GPU` is required.
* Install `CUDA` drivers
* Install dependencies
* Navigate to the `notebooks` folder included in the repository.
    * Execute the notebooks following the order of their names:
        * `1_Baseline_CNN_CIFAR.ipynb`
        * `2_Experiments.ipynb`
        * `3_Interpretability.ipynb`
        * `4_Transfer_learning.ipynb`
        * `5_Open_project.ipynb`


### Results
* Results of `Task1` are included directly in the executed notebook (`1_Baseline_CNN_CIFAR.ipynb`).
* Folder `task2-experiments` contain the results requested from `Task2` of the project.
* Folder `task3-visualizations` contain the results requested from `Task3` of the project.
* Folder `task4-losses` contain the results requested from `Task4` of the project.
* Folder `open-project` contain the results of the open project requested for `Task5`.
