# Image Classification using CNNs

## Overview
This project explores various aspects of `Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)` and their applications to image classification tasks. The primary dataset used is the EuroSAT dataset for land-use and land-cover classification. The project is divided into the following tasks:

1. Custom CNN
2. Experiments
3. Interpretability
4. Transfer Learning
5. Open Project

**The whole analysis and the respective results of the subsequent tasks and subtasks are presented in the [final report](./docs/Deep_Learning_Tasks_and_Land_Use_Land_Cover_Classification_Using_EuroSAT_Dataset.pdf).**

## Tasks and Targets

### Task 1: Custom CNN
Created a CNN model on the [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. Then:
- Studied memory requirements and computational load of each layer.
- Reason the differences between layers of different types.

### Task 2: Experiments
By using the `Task 1` model, the impact of the following points was studied:
- Data augmentation.
- Size of training batch.
- Batch normalization.
- Forced overfit and solved it using any method to control the complexity of the model.

### Task 3: Interpretability
Using:
- The custom `CNN` used in `Tasks 1` and `2`.
- A pre-trained model: `VGG16`[^1].
- The `CIFAR10` dataset.

Visualize:
- `Filters`.
- `Activations`.

Got top k-samples per unit. Presented `t-SNE` plot on each of the `Dense/Linear/Fully Connected` layers. Provided semantic interpretation.

### Task 4: Transfer Learning
1. Trained a custom `CNN` over the [Terrassa 900 dataset](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/resources/terrassa-buildings-4126) (v.2019).
2. **Feature extractor**: Trained a custom `CNN` over `CIFAR-10` and then:
    - Removed the output layer.
    - Freezed all the model layers.
    - Trained a new output layer over the `Terrassa 900 dataset`.
    - Tested on the validation set.
3. **Fine-tuning**:
    - Took a `VGG16` model and replaced the last layers with new layers.
    - Trained the model by freezing the layers closer to the input layer.
    - Retrained the not frozen layers and the new ones over the `Terrassa 900 dataset`.
    - Tested it on the validation set.
4. **Extra fine-tuning**:
    - Took a `VGG16` model.
    - Replaced the last layers with a new small network.
    - Trained the model freezing part of the layers closer to the input layer on the concatenation of the [Paris building](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/parisbuildings/) and `Terrassa 900` datasets.
    - Tested it on the validation set.


### Task 5: Land-use and Land-cover Classification using EuroSAT Dataset
By using the EuroSAT[^2] dataset (A Novel Dataset and Deep Learning Benchmark for Land Use and Land Cover Classification) performed the following tasks:
- Data exploration.
- Data preprocessing and preparation for usage with a `CNN`.
- Performed a resampling protocol adequate for DL.
- Created a `CNN` model and improved it to obtain a good classification score.
- Used `interpretability techniques` and gave semantic meaning to the model.
- Tested the model on unseen data, while the obtained results were studied by using a confusion matrix.
- Performed a post modeling analysis that includes which are the hardest classes to be predicted for the model, why is this the case, and if there is any bias in the predictions.

## Install Dependencies

Project was developed with the usage of `Python 3.9.9`.

To install the required libraries use the following command:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
